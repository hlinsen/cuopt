# Distance break example: a vehicle must take a mandatory break at a
# break location before its cumulative route distance exceeds 75 km.

# distance_max is a hard feasibility constraint, while distance_min is a soft
# target. routing.Objective.DISTANCE_BREAK_COST guides the search toward that
# target and sums the maximum lower-bound shortfall on each route. A break
# after distance_max makes the route infeasible. The objective's default weight
# is 1.0; configure another positive weight to change the tradeoff, or set it
# to 0.0 to disable the early-break penalty.

# between the two customers either lands the break past its 75 km window
# or backtracks far enough to be strictly more expensive.
